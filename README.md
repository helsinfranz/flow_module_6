## Getting Started

### Executing program

1. SPL Token Creation: In this we create a spl token that we are gonna use in further minting of NFTs, and naming it and giving it a logo as well.
2. Candy Machine Deploy: Now we need to deploy the candy machine in the devnet with all the assets and their associated JSONs.
